README for my final mod project for IT 266.

Mod: Quake-Rim (Quake 2 + Skyrim)

Main features:
- Replaced various weapons with Skyrim-based weapons
  - Railgun replaced with crossbow-type weapon
  - Shotgun replaced with bow-type weapon that fires in an arc (utilized grenade launcher functionality)
  - Blaster replaced with Sword melee weapon
     - Sword is the only melee weapon because I lack the creativity required to make other melee weapons that are not redundant. 
  - Implemented melee weapon framework
- Attempted to add Magic Spells (Still a work in progress)
  - Tried to change rocket launcher into fireball spell
    - Damage over time does not seem to be activating. If it is, then it is too fast for me to observe
  - Tried to add drain life spell by adapting a monster attack that was already in game.
    - Was not able to complete this
- Tried to add elemental strengths/weaknesses to monsters
  - The states are there but could not consistently trigger them.
GUI Changes:
-In order for players to know that the mod is working, a message is active at the bottom of the screen that says "QUAKE-RIM MOD IS ACTIVE"
